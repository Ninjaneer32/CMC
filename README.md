## Abstract
> Multimodal learning leverages complementary information derived from different modalities, thereby enhancing performance in medical image segmentation. However, prevailing multimodal learning methods heavily rely on extensive well-annotated data from various modalities to achieve accurate segmentation performance. This dependence often poses a challenge in clinical settings due to limited availability of such data. Moreover, the inherent anatomical misalignment between different imaging modalities further complicates the endeavor to enhance segmentation performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised multimodal segmentation framework that is robust to scarce labeled data and misaligned modalities. Our framework employs a novel cross modality collaboration strategy to distill modality-independent knowledge, which is inherently associated with each modality, and integrates this information into a unified fusion layer for feature amalgamation. With a channel-wise semantic consistency loss, our framework ensures alignment of modality-independent information from a feature-wise perspective across modalities, thereby fortifying it against misalignments in multimodal scenarios. Furthermore, our framework effectively integrates contrastive consistent learning to regulate anatomical structures, facilitating anatomical-wise prediction alignment on unlabeled data in semi-supervised segmentation tasks. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other multimodal methods across three tasks: cardiac, abdominal multi-organ, and thyroid-associated orbitopathy segmentations. It also demonstrates outstanding robustness in scenarios involving scarce labeled data and misaligned modalities.
